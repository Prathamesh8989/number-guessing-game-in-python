# number-guessing-game-in-python

This is a game which uses the random library 

first we ask for user to give us a number then we generate a random number from 0 to the number that user has provided us with here we also check whether the number is greater than 0 and also we check that it is actually a number or not 

then we iterate over asking for the user for numbers until he gets the right answer 

when the user guesses it correctly, we print that he got the number and the number of guesses required to do that
